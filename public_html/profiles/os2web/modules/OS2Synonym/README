This module allows transfer of synonyms to Apache Solr.

The following settings must be set:

'The name of Solr synonym file' The local synonyms.txt file the module will write synonyms to. The local Solr installation can be setup to read the synonyms from this file.

'The Solr core reload URL' The URL to call for a Solr core reload. For example: http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD&core=collection1

'The URL of the shared Solr synonyms text file' This allows the module to load synonyms from another Drupal installation. The URL could be set to http://<hostname>/OS2Synonym_download

The modules userinterface is located at /OS2Synonym. Here new synonyms can be manually entered, uploaded from a file, or from another Drupal installation.

The button 'Send to Solr' will save the synonyms ot the defined synonyms file and trigger a Solr core reload via the URL defined in settings.

Apache Solr can be setup to do either query time parsing or index time parsing of synonyms. Check Apache Solr's documentation for more information.
